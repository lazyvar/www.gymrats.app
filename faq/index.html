            <div class="faq-section">
              <h3>App</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <h4>How much does GymRats cost?</h4>
              <p>The app is free for all users, but that is likely to change in the future. Possible changes include charging for premium features or charging for groups having member count greater than some number.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>How is the app free?</h4>
              <p>The app is relatively cheap to run with server and media hosting being the two main costs. The freeness of the app is meant to attract new users, but that will change as the userbase grows.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>What do you do with my workout data?</h4>
              <p>Your data is used solely to facilitate the service of the application. GymRats does not, and never will, sell or give any data to any third parties for reasons of advertisement tracking or other. You can read more in the <a href="/privacy">privacy policy.</a></p>
              <br>
              <h4>Who is involved with the making of this app?</h4>
              <p>There is a single <a href="https://mack.cloud">software engineer</a> involved part-time alongside the help of some friends for ideas and product development.</p>

              <h3>Challenges</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <h4>How do I join a challenge?</h4>
              <p>To join a challenge someone who is already in the group needs to invite you. They can either send you an invite link or give you the code. If they send you a link, tap it and you will be prompted in the app to join the challenge. Alternatively, if you are given a code, tap "Join" from the menu and enter the code on the screen that is presented.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>What are the different challenge modes?</h4>
              <p>
                Classic is the default challenge mode. It is a 30 day challenge scored by most number of workouts. The goal is to simply workout more often. What defines a workout is up to the group to decide. 
              </p>
              <p>
                If classic is too limiting, you can create a custom challenge and define your own settings. Score by duration, distance, calories, steps, or come up with your own point system.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>How do I add someone to the challenge?</h4>
              <p>
                To invite someone to a challenge, first be on the challenge feed screen. Notice the three dots in the top right corner. Tap that button and select "Invite". You will be given the option to share a link through the share sheet. Alternatively, you can send someone the challenge code which you can get from the challenge details screen.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>How do I change information about a challenge?</h4>
              <p>
                To edit a challenge, first be on the challenge feed screen. Notice the three dots in the top right corner. Tap that button and select "Edit" or "Change banner".
              </p>
              <br>

            <div class="faq-content">
              <h4>How do I change my account information?</h4>
              <p>
                You can change your account information by navigating to the settings screen from either the profile screen or the slide out menu.
              </p>
              <br>

              <h3>Workouts</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <h4>Why can't I log a workout?</h4>
              <p>To log a workout, you must be in an active challenge. If the challenge has not started yet, you will not be allowed to log a workout... that would be cheating!</p>
              <br>
              <h4>How do I log a workout?</h4>
              <p>
                You can log a workout by hitting the big red activity button at the bottom of the screen. If this button isn't showing, make sure you are part of an active challenge.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>Why is a photo required for posting a workout?</h4>
              <p>Since this is a competition, proof of workout is needed. Provide proof by photo of gym, sweaty selfie, or screenshot of running app.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>What devices wearables can I log a workout with?</h4>
              <p>GymRats does not support direct integration with third-party devices like Garmin, FitBit, etc. GymRats does however integrate with the Apple Health app. If your activity is saved there, you can import it in GymRats.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>How do I import a workout from the Apple Health app?</h4>
              <p>On the log workout screen look for the "Import workout from the Health App" button. You must give the app permission to use this feature.</p>
